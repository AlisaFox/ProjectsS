# The Mess

Called so because it is literally a mess. I will try and make things clear in this README, but the individual folders most likely won't
have their own. 

## 1. OCaml
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/learn/description.html) is a functional language with an emphasis on recursion. Inside that folder I have a bunch of exercises like the mergesort algorithm, a banking stimulation, map colouring, and others.

## 2. Assembly
[MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) code bits. Really low level stuff. Worked a bit with images. (TO DO: Can I find the pdfs for this?)

## 3. BMP
This is actually a C project, but without the pdf it makes zero sense. Plus I don't think it is fully completed. It was something along 
the lines of overlaying two images by using bitmap images

## 4. Circuits
Here I designined and simulated logic circuits. Files to be opened with logisim. Some were fun, like KITT (the car) from Knight Rider was imitated (well at least the flashing red lights).

## 5. Extensions
I've made a couple of extensions for tampermonkey to make life easier.

## 6. Fitch Proofs
These have nothing to do with coding, they are logic proofs from my deductive logic class. The format of the files is just weird.

## 7. LHD
I forgot what this is about. It's a java course representation, but I forgot what this was for, or where the name lhd even comes from.

## 8. Lisp
I learnt how to code in [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) for a psychology course. It is a coding language made for lists. The course used coding to run stimulations, like of what happened with the Neanderthals when they went extinct. I only put up the first assignment though, as the rest were mostly the professor's work with a couple of my own optimizations. 

## 9. Waldo
This is an another assembly MIPS code bit. However I know what it does so it was put in a different folder. It compares bits in an image of your typical waldo puzzle, with an image of Waldo. It then highlights waldo if he is found in green.
