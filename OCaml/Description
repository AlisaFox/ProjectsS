Started learning OCaml winter 2019. Started off with studying recursion and playing around with exponentation (ex. rpe)
# let even n = (n mod 2) = 0;;
# let odd n = (n mod 2) = 1;;
# let rec rpe base power =
if base = 0 then 0
else
if power = 0 then 1
else
if (odd power) then
base * (rpe base (power - 1))
else
let tmp = (rpe base (power/2)) in
tmp * tmp;;
